            I've done. Enjoy!</p>

        <h3>Quick crazy facts about me!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm an Eagle Scout!</li>
            <li>I'm from Elkhart, Indiana!</li>

        <p> I (Michael) am a third year Computer Science major.<br>
            When I'm not coding and studying, I live a relatively standard college life- I eat ramen and rice, I play
            some video games, and I don't get enough sleep.(case in point, it is currently very late)<br>
            This last summer, I worked at Gentex Corp. in Zeeland, Michigan creating test cases and environments to test products in. It was a fun time!.<br>
            I work hours at the SRC (Student Recreation Center) as a lifeguard to help "pay the bills", so to speak and
            that's a great time. I've lifeguarded for multiple years to this point, and it is a very valuable skill of
            mine.<br>
            It is my opinion that pineapple does indeed belong on pizza. It is so yummy <br>
            My freshman year I was on the varsity swim team, but for the last two years I have been actively playing for the club Ultimate Frisbee team.<br>
            I am an avid Detroit Lions fan, meaning I am well accustomed to pain, pain and more pain because unfortunately that's all the franchise ever gives.<br>
            Anyway if you're still interested, click through some of the projects I've worked through, or check out my
            resume, and have a nice day!
